# Welcome

We are proud to introduce you the powerful build system that makes building, distributing, and vendoring easier than ever! You'll write the required commands to perform an operation in both Windows and Linux vendor scripts just once, and you'll no longer have to remember those again when pushing the next version!

This system acts as a wrapper for your vendor scripts that you'll have to implement for your project, which simplifies workflows and to minimize clutter when working with workflows, such as CI/CD integrated environments.

To get started, follow the instructions in the below page:

{% content-ref url="build-system/getting-started.md" %}
[getting-started.md](build-system/getting-started.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

To learn more about the structure of the system, take a look here:

{% content-ref url="build-system/structure.md" %}
[structure.md](build-system/structure.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
